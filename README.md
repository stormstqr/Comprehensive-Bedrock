# Comprehensive-Bedrock
A wiki to introduce players to the expansive culture of Minecraft Bedrock Edition

This repository and wiki aims to develop an introductory insight into the many subcommunities that make up the players of Bedrock. Our goal is to promote creativity and wonder to keep these communities active by easing the learning curve some may experience when first joining. Minecraft is a very large and diverse game, which appeals to a wide variety of people with many different interests. Here, we aim to show the basics of many parts of the game in a way that may help people taylor their experience in a manner that appeals to their interests. Additionally, by providing a centralized basic repository of Bedrock information, we hope to guide players towards aspects that they may not have explored before.
